        Taking notes during lectures

Some alternatives methods for taling notes during lectures are the
following.

  * Use pen and paper to make some handwritten notes, where needed.
  * Use a tablet, such as iPaD, to add annotations to slides (not
    necessarily the same as instructor's annotations).
  * For annotating a pdf file on a laptop computer, a useful app is
    xournalpp (xournal++); this is better than Acrobat Reader which can
    only annotate with sticky notes.
  * For slides with much annotations made in class, if you cannot
    logically recover main ideas in your review after class, ask in a
    later lecture for them to be shown in class. Then you can take a
    photo (so choose a seat where photo taking of the screen is
    possible) and write better notes after class. 


        Study habits for Stat 443

  * Attend lectures and labs to focus on key concepts, theory and case
    studies.
  * Keep up to date with lecture materials, homework, labs; refer to
    notes from pre-requisite courses when needed.
  * Glance at lecture slides/notes in advance of lectures. Read the
    slides carefully after class. See below for what is meant by "reading".
  * Ask questions in piazza if needed; do homework promptly to check
    your understanding.
  * Lecture notes and slides will have many questions that you can do to
    assess your conceptual and mathematical understanding.
    Because it is best if you can come up with *your own logical
    reasoning * to answer the questions, most of the questions will not
    be discussed immediately but deferred to homework or a future
    lecture so that everyone has time to think them over.

      o It is not expected that you can answer the questions immediately.
      o The answers to these questions typically require using ideas
        from previous math and statistics courses. It is better if you
        make a few tries to answer these questions on your own. A few
        tries means that if you are stuck, then retry later after
        discussion with classmates or getting hints from piazza or TAs.
      o Looking up answers on the internet at the first approach does
        not help you in the long run (e.g., prepare for career or
        graduate studies) because more important than answers are
        acquiring problem solving techniques and adding to your tool kit.
      o Also note that the quality of information on the internet is mixed. 

  * It is difficult to make lecture slides typo-free. If you are
    understanding course material, you should be able to fix the typos.
    For typos that are discovered during class time, the corrections
    will be made via an iPad or on the blackboard. The iPad will also be
    used to add annotations to the slides. Annotated slides will not be
    posted.

  * Reading the textbook, lecture notes and R code examples means the
    following.
      o Verify derivations and theory, and pay attention to common
        techniques and logical reasoning.
      o Connect new theory to the theory in previous statistics courses
        (e.g., estimation, interval estimation, expected values/
        variances/covariance for linear combinations)
      o Pay attention to terminology: why do different concepts have
        their given names? Examples are: autocorrelation, serial
        correlation, partial correlation, autoregressive, moving
        average, random walk.

      o R code examples: if some functions are new to you, execute the R
        code line-by-line and check output of each line for
        understanding. Match the model in the R output to notation used
        in lectures. Use theory from the textbook and lectures to verify
        outputs of R functions that are based on model parameter
        estimates. /Labs may include exercises of this type./ 

  * Data examples and term project: start with exploratory data
    analysis, transform variables if needed to satisfy assumptions of
    statistical methods to be used; match interpretation of model
    outputs to exploratory data analysis so that results make sense.

  * Do you know the difference between (rote) memorization and
    understanding as you take more advanced courses? If you are a
    memorizer, learn from study habits of others, especially, from a
    classmate who can learn and process course material without
    memorization.

  * Exam preparation: can you summarize the most important concepts and
    results in one page. Note that the important results are not
    formulas; they are the derivations and properties of statistical
    models/methods and estimators.

  * Main learning objective of Stat 443: add to your math/statistics/
    computing toolkit for problem solving and data analysis.
  * If you would like to go on to graduate studies, there are additional
    study habits that can help your preparation.

  * Group-based homework: to profit from working with classmates,
    contribute your share, ask questions about parts you don't
    understand in order to improve the writing in mathematical answers
    and interpretations in data analysis. You are hurting yourself if
    you are copying or getting answers from the internet without
    understanding.
