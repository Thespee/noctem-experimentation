# Ideation Prompt

Hello, I want to use the software PraxisLive to do some projection mapping.
The first obstacle is setting up different surfaces that I can combine into one projected screen.
I want to take the basics from map.club and recreate something I can run locally. 

Praxislive Documentation:  https://docs.praxislive.org/

[Map.club](http://Map.club) overview: [https://map.club/docs/overview](https://map.club/docs/overview)

can you give me a rundown of if this is possible and how you would go about implementing this?
