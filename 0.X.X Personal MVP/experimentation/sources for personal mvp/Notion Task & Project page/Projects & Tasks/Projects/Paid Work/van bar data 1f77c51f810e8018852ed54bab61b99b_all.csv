While taking it out, the door stop slipped and I was locked out. No sweat, the building operations manager is scheduled to still be around for another 30 minutes. He left early that night. Campus security was my next best bet. They didn't think 'I left the lights on' constituted an emergency, so there was nothing they could do. I was now in territory uncharted by the SOP manual. I took a guess that one of the overnight cleaners (responsible for the whole student building, not the bar, we had our own cleaning staff), might have access. I quickly found a janitor that I had shared cookies with after a shift a month or so before this, and explained my situation. He said he didn't have an official key to the place, but her could try. The UBC student building uses many of the same locks; I was in, closed the lights, and went home.

I had been keeping my manager updated on the situation in real time, although he was asleep at the time. "
