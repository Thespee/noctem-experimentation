Hello, 
I made it my mission to be completely financially independent this year and I am here to give an update and to boldly claim: holy heck it’s tough out here, I want to go home.   I worked 3 paying jobs: restaurant host for ~1 month (Quit to focus on coop applications), a coop for 4 months, and currently a barback & bartender in training (~2.5 months). In this time I have also served on the exec teams of 3 organizations (frat, the start up, and a not-for-profit party promotion org). I have saved up enough for tuition for a term and a bit, but I would need to work a job on-top of my 5 courses and continuing exec involvement in order to afford rent and food expenses. Why am I messaging you now? Well I have just been informed that an alumni scholarship I expected to win will be going to someone else (it was p well mine until they extended the deadline because there weren't enough applicants), and this would have covered all of my rent and a bit more tuition for the upcoming term. I understand that with the renovations and new condo purchase, liquidity might not be at an all time high, so I want to reassure you that I will be able to avoid starving under a bridge if it doesn't make sense to send me anything at the time being. I want to negotiate a plan with you both that would involve you paying for my rent (v critical) and some portion of my tuition (less important) and I'd fund the rest (food and nonsense). Ask any questions you have, and I patiently await your response. 

Cheers,
