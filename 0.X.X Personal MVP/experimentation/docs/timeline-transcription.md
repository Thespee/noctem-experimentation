- Donate as many of these to students & under-served
- Could partner w/ libraries (minimal support, esp. financial, from library itself - promote idea and use cases to people who can't pay)

**[Arrow pointing down]** Move text to Jack Dorsey protocol for sending texts through a crowd of people hopscotching over bluetooth radio waves (local mesh networking)
