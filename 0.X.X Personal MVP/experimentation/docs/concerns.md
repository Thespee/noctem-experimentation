### Layers of Security[^1]

- **Outer nodes** are simple; may be a smart fridge; unsecure
- **Inner layers** → more privacy & more optimized for anonymity AND growth[^2]

### Technical Bits

- Need syntax for sources/reference
- Verify personage
- Local communication → BT radio waves

---

## Page 2: Goals

- Backwards & cross hardware capability
- Robust "trees" as pillars for a "Human" verified sources
- Decentralized
- Everyone has their own support tree, independent

## Issues

- Security
- Minimal resource use
- Copyright

### CORE SKILLS[^3]

*(Competency sharing from model to model using very limited scope skills or components)*

## Aspirations

- Remove AI from capitalism

---

## MVP 1.0.0

- Main USB w/ problem/task router
- Signal text (s/features)
- Create a new drive as easy as possible

### Future Stages

- **Parent**: optimizer & troubleshooting
- **Birth**: initial deployment

## Economic Grounding

- Tie to geo-location → land tax is only viable test[^4]

## Footnotes

[^1]: **Q:** The spiral diagram on the left - is this representing layers of security/trust radiating outward?
**A:** Yes, kind of—with a tree bark metaphor.

[^2]: **Q:** "optimized for ~~anonymity~~ growth" - was anonymity crossed out in favor of growth?
**A:** No, both are priorities.

[^3]: **Q:** "CORE SKILLS" written vertically on the right margin - should this be associated with the Issues list?
**A:** This is an idea about how to handle competency sharing from model to model using very limited scope skills or components.

[^4]: **Q:** "Tie to geo-location → land tax is only viable test" - can you clarify this?
**A:** This is about a theory of taxation (Georgism/Adam Smith) that posits the only viable and morally good tax is on land use. Not about jurisdictional grounding for the software.
