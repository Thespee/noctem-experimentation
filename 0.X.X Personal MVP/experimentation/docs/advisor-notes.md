## Big Theory

If the software & models are tuned for a specific person, they shouldn't require as much resources to run efficiently; distributed over many old/custom devices with 1 heart (cor Unum)[^1] that "lives" across all of them.

## Notes

- Use more Canadian specifics; grounding
- **Cognitive burden**: I need a pressure valve
- **Ambient computing**: distributed is an important aspect too; assume not all 1 system; computers running tasks, actual computing via components which are highly specialized & potentially shared between people/cores
- **Equalizing**: if 100% of people had this USB, libraries could provide the entire world with access to computing. People of means can create private, better systems

> **It needs more research into how individuals can own their data.**

> **How small can we get the components? Makes improvement over time easier.**

- [Historical reference omitted][^2]
- They should host an everlong conversation about "how" to get to an agreed end goal; equals in that game
- Both act as advisors on the other's conduct
- **Right to personhood**: can we do that?
- Live heard parties or verification w/ anonymize
- **Twilio** → easier to set up for others; one could register # use w/o them
- More focus on customizing the models over time to be "your" digital mind

### General Use Considerations

- Copyright system replace
- Speculate on keeping the "shared info" of OpenClaw w/ security
- Later: Digital Aristotle[^3]
- Proof of person = verified

### Target Versions

- **v0.5**: What I want ASAP from you (the dev)
- **v1.0**: Speculate on this version—one I'd be willing to share with friends[^4]

## Footnotes

[^1]: **Q:** "cor Unum" - is this the Latin phrase meaning "one heart"? (used in context of a system that "lives" across all devices)
**A:** Yes, this is "one heart" and that's the correct metaphor.

[^2]: **Q:** "1960: L-t liger" - what does this reference?
**A:** Don't worry about this, lost to history.

[^3]: **Q:** "Digital Aristotle" - confirm this is the concept of a personal AI tutor?
**A:** Yes, Digital Aristotle is a personal AI tutor.

[^4]: **Q:** The notation "v0.sketches" in the header - is that the version label?
**A:** No, that was "v0.5" (what I want ASAP from you the dev), and "speculate on v1.0" (a version I'd be willing to share with friends).
