*Note: The questions posed in this essay are representative of past ideas during early project conception, not necessarily current direction.*[^2]

## On Defining Life

What defines life? If one were to be all but 1 mind with one "artificial being": born together & pass on together.

## Vision of the Future

The future I see is where everyone has one; the "right to compute" is recognized & provided.

### Philosophical Grounding

- **Eastern ("religious") philosophy** would say: focus on the smallest things possible
- **Western philosophy**: align thoughts w/ optimal good

---

## The Onion Model

I see these beings as **onion shaped**:

- **Outer skin**: made of what we'd call smart devices & basic non-generative skills
- **Sub agents**: for internal distributed command
- **Linking & sharing information**: in a Git-like fashion[^1]

## Open Research Questions

*(Historical—representative of early project thinking)*

1. What does the core look like?
2. What drives an onion to grow?
3. What causes a homosapien to grow consciously?

---

## Aspirational Question

> How could this tech be used towards a future where life of all kind can flourish & explore?

---

## Closing

I feel that the pieces are before me & I just need to put them together.
