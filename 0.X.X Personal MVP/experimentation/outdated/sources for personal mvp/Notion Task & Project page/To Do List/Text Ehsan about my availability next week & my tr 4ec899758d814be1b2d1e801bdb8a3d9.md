# Text Ehsan about my availability next week & my trip back to Ottawa

Start Date: July 11, 2023

Hello sir, wanted to get this in writing. My mum booked flights back to Ontario and I only just got the itinerary this weekend. I'm gone August 1st and fly back early in the morning on the 23rd (I could do a 5-11pm shift that day). I hadn't realised how long I'd be gone for, apologies for the semi late notice.
