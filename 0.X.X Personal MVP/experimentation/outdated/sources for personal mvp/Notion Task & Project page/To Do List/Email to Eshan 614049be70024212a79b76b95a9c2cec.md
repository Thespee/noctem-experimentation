Hello sir,
I know we have openings for bartenders here at the Gal, I want to be the one to fill those openings ASAP or by next term. I have a bit of bartending experience through a catering company I worked at as well as during student events but those have had very limited menus & often not at a physical bar set up. Mahdi and Kimi have trained me on setting up of beer and sangria kegs, what prep work is done (eg dehydrating fruits), opening the bar (organizing all the bottles, setting up glass washer, etc.), as well as clean up of the bar at the end of the night. Plus I’ve done a bit of bar backing during events this summer. I was wondering if there was anything you had concerns with regarding my work here so far and if there was any training or things I could do to improve my chances at becoming a bartender here. I know we had some trouble with me showing up on time last week, but I have been making an effort to arrive early to my shifts now days. I was also thinking that I could memorize our cocktail menu beforehand, but is there anything else that comes to mind?
