# Let’s be open on the weekends

we have the license, the nest is open, other bars are open, we can help the pit as a funnel on nights they have events

# Purpose

- Fix current over-staffing issues
- regain market share from on campus competitors
- Optimized marketing efficiency: Reducing handoffs, specialized role
- Pilot over summer to ensure success in the winter
- Student lead: give the students that work here a chance to implement their ideas

# Definition of Success

- “I’m bored, I guess I’ll go Gal”
    - The people filling the thousands of residences on campus
    - soon, hundreds more being built each year
    - summer: **ubc staff, summer students, degrees ending in July (eg, edu), Irish, construction workers (?), book upper lounge to ams clubs free of charge**
- Lean Machine: Minimal additional overhead, admin, staff, prep

# Operations

open 1230pm - 8pm, focusing on hungover brunch people and pregame crowds

# People

Focus on lowest number of people possible, opening:

- ALL can have at least 1 more come in sometime **after 4pm**, this person can then stay until midnight closing down

### Front of House

- Full bar menu
- Schedule 2 bartenders, one acting as a ‘weekend manager’ **noon - 8** (8h max shift)
    - focus on the minimal prep drinks, can keep the many left overs we generate on Fridays
- Brunch time (all day?) Mimosa pitchers
- Bussers: Help kitchen putting dishes through washer (reduce # of people)
- Busser on the same **noon - 8**

## Finance (estimates)

|  | $22 / h * 8h | bonus weekend pay
8h max shifts |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| * | 1+2+2+3 | 1 “manager”
2 bartenders
2 Bussers
3 Kitchen staff → less?  | Talked with staff about what they’d think they’d need to run a happy hour only kitchen menu |
| + | $1000 | Material costs & Other Expenses |  |
| = | 2408 | Total 
(worst case scenario)  |  |

### Back of House

- Required for food primary license
- Not a good idea to give people alc without food options
- Happy hour all day, minimal prep
- not sure of kitchen req: minimal prep happy hour, and bussers helping putting dishes through, I talked to them and it could be a 1 person operation.
    - This is how other places I currently work at run.

# Resources / Funding

Nothing much…

- Manager on shift responsible primarily for marketing during his down time, assuming the bulk of the overhead isn’t affected and still handled by their current people

### Marketing

- The ams has  a marketing department, but the issue is they aren’t solely focused on the Gal’s requirements, and because of their large scope, don’t have quick turn around times
- This ‘weekend manager’ could take over the Instagram as well as other marketing requirements, without the need to create a whole new position. (All that would be scheduled would be bartenders)
- Summer: For the groups listed above in the definition of success section, I think offering all day happy hour deals (with ‘proof of membership’ would be a great idea. The ‘trick’ here is trying to cover enough groups that everyone who is around campus during the summer feels like they’ve been invited personally.
- Aiming for cheque seizes of $20 paying customer, we would need to only hit 71 people to begin making a profit. I think this is guaranteed during the year, but using the summer as a testing opportunity is invaluable

## **Hire me for this “weekend manager job”**
