Hello,

My name is Alexander Grinius. (20712972). I was supposed to graduate last year, pulled a whoopsie on a final, and didn’t meet the requirements. I am now retaking the offending course, STAT 443, which had been the only course preventing my graduation last year. I need help because my already submitted application will be automatically declined regardless. 

Checking the requirements now, it seems like some system update affected how my degree completion is being calculated. This is expected as I began studies in 2019, swapped faculty to my current degree in 2020, and have not had a smooth ride since. My graduation application in 2025 was only prevented by the “STAT courses level 400 or above (3 needed)” requirement when I failed STAT 443. Now there are 4 unsatisfied requirements (image 1), laboratory science, MATH V, now 6 credits in STAT4##, and a SCIE 113 requirement. Here we go:

1. Laboratory science: image 3 shows what courses count when I began in 2020/21, image 4 shows I completed PHYS 159 to satisfy; chem 154 also had a laboratory component, I still own the lab coat & goggles
2. MATH V: image 3 also shows that I did MATH_V 101 when it was for engineering students. 
3. 6 STAT 4## credits: My original degree requirements (image 6) weren’t as specific about upper year courses; when I took STAT 301, it wasn’t a specific requirement, and last graduation cycle, it counted as 3 of 6 STAT 3## credits. One of either STAT 406 or 450 was counting as the other 3 STAT 4## credits letting me graduate. As it stands, the other course I could take, STAT 405, is closed this term, and I really don’t want to keep dragging this into the summer. 
4. SCIE 113: Was not a thing when I got here. I would like to posit that I have completed an equivalent amount of learning through other courses: ENGL 112 emphasised developing an argument and finding supporting evidence, APSC 100 & 101 covered communication and information gathering skills (image 4), STAT 404 may be the most in depth look one could take on judging research papers; and finally, STAT 450 was the entirety of SCIE 113 in real practice (worked with a current UBC masters student on his research) with close mentoring. 

What’s going on here; Is there any world where I can graduate this may? My tank is empty and I worry the gas station is a mirage.

Cheers,

Alexander Grinius
