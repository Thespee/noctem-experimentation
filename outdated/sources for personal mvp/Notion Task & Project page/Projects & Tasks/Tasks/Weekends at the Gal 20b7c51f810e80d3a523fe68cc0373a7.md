Hello all,

For those who I have not had the pleasure of meeting in person, my name is Alex, I have worked at the Gallery as a busser then bartender and Karaoke guy since 2023. Attached is a detailed proposal to open the Gallery on the weekends. The main points are summarized here:

1. Why: There is suitable number of people on campus, we already have the licence, we have more workers than shifts both front of house and back, competitors like browns and sports illustrated do
2. How: focus on running minimal prep and overhead, limited hours (1230-9), have a bartender on that can act as a pseudo ‘marketing manager’, brunch??
3. You should want me for the ‘marketing manager role’: most interconnected person on our staff (within ubc), most location specific knowledge (sound system, menu, equipment locations), past event org and management & promotion experience

I have spoken with all members of our staff, as well as both the bar manager and restaurant manager, the only thing I am looking for is the ok. 

Thank you for your considerations,

Alex Grinius
