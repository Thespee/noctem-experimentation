# wiki

Status: In Progress
Project: Finish School (../Projects/Finish%20School%202e97c51f810e8097baeafd2726873b53.md)

Hello, hope you’re doing well today! I’ve gotta make a wiki for myself for a statistics course I’m taking. I want to do this in obsidian with wikipedia like markdown files specifically tailored to helping me access knowledge for assignments.

Goal: create a plan for yourself to build this & complete all the tasks; ask clarification questions; create a scope document for the plan with all info one would need; next goal will be to create it. 

You are in the master directory:
- 2025: files from a past student; ignore 
- Sources: the text book as a github repo, a markdown file with the current state of the course website, and every relevant file that’s mentioned on the website
- Wiki: where you will be creating this wiki, contains a blank home page right now
- Basic formatting: review of markdown in obsidian; 

Tasks: 
1. edit the website markdown file so that the links point to the correct files in the website sources
2. come up with plan on how to best organize information; keep focus on material specifically for this class; have an option to create more notes later for stuff outside of this class
3. All pages should be made up of 1/2 sentence summaries of quotations from somewhere with links to where the source is as well as a section on how to do in R
4. Notes should cross-link (hyperlink) to each other as much as possible (mostly with-in the summaries) to explain how consepts relate; plan to go over all notes periodically (don’t worry about frequency) to change summaries and hyperlinks
5. home page should be minimal with sub pages that describe a full topic list; a weekly materials page (updates with new versions of the website; will be done manually); and a page specifically dedicated for referencing coding materials.
