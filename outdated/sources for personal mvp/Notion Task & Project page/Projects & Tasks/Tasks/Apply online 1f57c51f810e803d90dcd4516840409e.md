Employment Inquiry - Bartending / Barback

Hi my name is Alex. I am a recent UBC grad seeking employment as a bartender / barback asap. I have 2+ years of experience in bars, fully licensed, and my references immediately available to send; BUT, I'm sure you hear this all the time.

What sets me apart:

- Kitchen worker previously: I am able to interact smoothly out of the gate
- Sound Equipment Set Up: set up DJs and live bands; host & market weekly karaoke
- Event Organization: licensing, employing, contracting, booking, marketing; most recent event in March grossed $1,681

Thank you for your time, and please don't hesitate to reach out if there is an open position.
