# Alex MVP

To include:

- stat443 drive
- refresh researched git
- notion task viewer
- blackbook version it can use rto make birthday updater

Prompt: 

Hope your day is going well, I have some help I need from you;  review this drive doc folder to understand where we are right now; I need to work on other things so just want a more minimal version of this for it to start doing something useful as soon as possible; I’m going to give you a list of things that I want done, you are going to write up a review of how we could make this happen today. For now ask any clarifying questions you can think of, repeat  questioning until you are satisfied that it could happen by the end of the day. 

Your tasks for today: 

- make a new sub-folder in this drive to store this personal mvp & the progress;
    - you will need to merge the moltbot folder & it’s docs with the rest of the folder system first; this was a first draft and while I want to carry ideas forward, the project as it is now is a more recent vision for the project.
    - there are other sources and what not that are relevant to this task that you will have to sort and organize; no code need’s to be looked at yet → that will come when we start to build the thing; there is a sources for personal mvp folder that you can look into
- arrange these tasks from easiest to hardest to implement;
- recommend alterations to complete the goals below, and make it easier to update to the 1.0 mvp version described in these files (this personal one is v 0.5 in my mind)
- create a file that walks me though how to set up the physical usb (again 1tb drive, I want 128gb storage “shared” partition that acts like a regular usb accessible from other machines and the system itself.

Goals for this first version:

- Can start automating easy tasks for me today
- update able without massive system interruptions (it’s still expected to be unplugged an re-plugged occasionally)
- keep track of everything it’s doing currently and historical

below is a description of “tasks” or components I want working in this mvp

System (this is part of the feature list and will likely be in the final minimal version too) : 

- Error handling;
    - doesn’t stop if a task experiences an error;
    - makes a report (doesn’t have to notify me immediately), this is just data for later
    - pauses task and moves onto next task
- Signal text message  → creating a task
    - I want to text it commands that are in somewhat plain english (see how todoist handles slightly natural language input) instructions to create a task;
    - should confirm a task & parameters with me before creating ;
- Replace notion and todoist as my personal task tracker;
    - kinda goes with the above;I want to interact with this system through the daily reports & simple language commands via signal.
    - this will be a super set of the tasks that the computer is doing;
    - I imagine completing this task list like a partnership;
    - I can share a version of what this looks like atm → its notion, but I like the repeating tasks and many other features from todoist → will add a file with a snapshot of what that looks like for me in the file for the personal mvp you create
    - It would be nice to create a text ui version of this I can view on the web; doesn’t have to be pretty just give me the gist of what I should be doing
- website: view details about current queue & current task from my phone;
    - Can be melded with the text ui from the tasks bit above
- create a shared drive partition on the usb that lets me use part of this like a regular usb;
- keeps data / records on everything it’s doing so that it can be improved quantitatively later
- Auto starts from where it left off & ability to pause and power-down

Simple tasks:

- regular updates
    - Morning:
        - includes any birthdays (from a database I have already; name and birthday field), will provide sample when you’re developing this part
        - Summary of plan for today; tasks I could work on and the systems.
        - I like 8 am pst or whatever timezone I am in
    - Hourly updates
        - what has been done; what it’s current state is; and what’s next
    - Evening (12h from morning):
        - Report on the day; brieft update on what is happening tomorrow
    - Can read only my calendar (will send it a local ics file so avoid access from foreign systems)

warp (since I don’t have a strong enough local system I will use you as a replacement; there needs to be some sanitation or anonimizer when making requests, I can’t help that they will all come from the same account) 

- Research
    - as input I want a topic or central question; the first one is the one that’s briefly explored in the research folder at the moment
    - Attempts to find 5  sources on the topic; including 1 reddit post from pre gpt llms in 2020 and one research paper that’s reasonably credible
    - stores local copies of anything used (only needs basic text or pdfs) and creates a summary of the information
    - generates 3 related research questions with the new info gained from sources
    - repeats this until a certain depth of sources (number downloaded → able to use some as repeats); summaries created (per 5 sources); or number of research questions are asked
    - Basic version of this exists in the directory already
- create mvps for software for myself
    - Should be stored in the shared drive so I can easily spin them up on another machine
    - I should be able to create and edit “project detail” files on a website or directly from within the shared drive that describes in full detail what I want
    - “task” creates something minimal that I can try and provide feedback on
    - some sort of update previous mvps after feedback should be implemented too
- Data-scraper
    - I want to give it a type of data, sources I’d pull from , and a data structure to output
    - should develop how to do this & run a task more continually that scrapes that data and puts it into ta a database; I wanna be able to view that database live from a website
    - similar descriptions and task file as software mvps to be created on the local drive; data doesn't need to be accessed vie that shared drive; can keep it all on the website
- Tutor;
    - I need to spin up a website that can tutor me through topics while I’m on another machine
    - like the file structure & heavy use of primary source citation as seen in stat443; can you suggest improvements to generate these websites and use cases faster?
    - Use of AI should be somewhat limited, but used to ask questions and confirm understanding of topics
    - maybe work in tandem with the researcher post hoc to tutor me on a research topic
