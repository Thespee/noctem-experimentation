# Scope for “computer”

Hi I want to create an entirly local version of Moltbot, that runs from linux booting from a usb; right now I want you to produce documents for how I would set this up best; explaining the whole process

Goals: 
- portable; adaptable to different hardware
- makes tasks for me easier, optimized for my specific life
- include plans for how this model could go about implementing some of the model tasks; each plan a separate document; useable by this model

Example tasks:
- Create internet scrapers for specific forms of data; create entries in databases
- build software in the background
- tells me when I have free time; reading calendar
- produce summaries of texts/emails

Please ask any clarifying questions before we begin

potentially useful sources; find your own too :D
