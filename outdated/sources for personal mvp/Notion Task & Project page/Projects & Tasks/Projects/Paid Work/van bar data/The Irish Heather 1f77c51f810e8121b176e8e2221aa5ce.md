Written email / cover letter: Hi Sean,My name is Alex and I am emailing to inquire about any employment opportunities you may have as a bartender or barback. I've got more than 2 full years of part time experience, fully licenced, and ready to provide references - BUT, I'm sure you hear that everyday.What sets me apart is what I can do outside of bartending: - I planned, set-up, marketed, and host a weekly karaoke event at the bar I currently tend at. This event brings in ~$1k - 1.5K extra on the nights that it's hosted. - I have lots of experience setting up sound systems (DJs or live bands) - I run the finances and organizational structure of an independent artist collective called funhouse. Events I run with this group net $700 - $1200, allowing the artists to pursue their art.My full resume is attached, and I am ready to send over references if needed.Best, Alex Griniusp.s. Not sure how to fit this into the email, but I have lived with irish people before, enjoy the craic and whiskey.
