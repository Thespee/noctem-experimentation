Written email / cover letter: Hi Eilis,My name is Alex and I am 
emailing to inquire about any employment opportunities you may have as a
 bartender or barback. I've got more than 2 full years of part time 
experience, fully licensed, and ready to provide references - BUT, I'm 
sure you hear that everyday.What sets me apart is what I can do outside of bartending: -
 I planned, set-up, marketed, and hosted a weekly karaoke event at the 
bar I currently tend at. This event brings in ~$1k - 1.5K extra on the 
nights that it's hosted. - I have lots of experience setting up sound systems (DJs or live bands) -
 I run the finances and organizational structure of an 
independent artist collective called funhouse. Events I run with this 
group net $700 - $1200, allowing the artists to pursue their art.My full resume is attached, and I am ready to send over references if needed.Best, Alex Griniusp.s.
 Not sure how to fit this into the email, but anytime we've had beer at 
one of those art events, it's been a Main St. keg through Owain, Nigel's
 son.
