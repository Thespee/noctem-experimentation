# The Statistical Life

Start Date: December 1, 2024

Basically the idea here is to write a first version of my modern guide to being a big frat guy. Each chapter will be named after a relevant Greek god and consist of a story section (from my life or otherwise) and a moral / lesson section. The goal is to introduce myself to the world through stories and instruct people on the general principals that I lead my life by. I want it to be as short and easy to digest as possible.
