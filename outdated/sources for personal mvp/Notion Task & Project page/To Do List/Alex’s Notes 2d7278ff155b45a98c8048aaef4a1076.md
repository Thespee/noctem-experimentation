# Alex’s Notes

Start Date: September 3, 2023

Aug 31st

- Going to be gong the charity route, meeting with the team on sunday
- message: aight boys meeting at Elwoods Sunday at 5pm. Things to finalize: Date, Audience (who we could rope into this), charity, finance for the summer, who our team is, what kind of posts & marketing we’re going to do, the location, and the schedule moving forward. Hyped for this boys

Exec Meeting Notes:
- Refocus on our goal of introducing people at UBC to this sort of music
- New goal of bringing something new / unique to ADP
- We need an Instagram that people can see and understand what we’re doing
- Alastair and I settled on FunHouseUBC → it’s approachable and defines our target audience
- Party last Friday went well, security indoors worked, ADP boys liked it, sharing equipment w/ UBC raves was good, bar operated well
- Need non-irish on door because it’s rude to ask them to charge their friends
- Need to plan out rhythm of the night better so people slowly move down → means playing more mainstream & sing alongs at the start
- Next parties on July 28th, April 11th & 25th, if ADP grabs on we can keep gong during year
- Next steps: I want an instagram & ticket link (most likely eventbright) up by Wednesday night, Ali and Beau working on the graphics, I’ll do the registration side
- I want to schedule some sesh with some of the guys from UBC Raves to see if we want any of them performing, I know I liked one of them and it’ll help keep that relationship strong

Structure org

Planning:

- What needs to be done once
- What needs to be done before a party
- what needs to be done during a party
- what needs to be done after a party

Notes:

Compensation

- I want to discuss what type of compensation would be best
- I like 20 20 20 40 for this first one, but I think more realistically we got even and then change it after this one → we can discuss what percent of things we should get on a rolling basis, especially if there’s going to be weeks we miss
- Everyone else we “contract out” as cheaply as possible, we want them to feel like they’re winning

Structure org

- We run a ticket sales focus business that contracts out drinks to Aleks
- For this first one, we attempt to get the in group to front as much of the cost as possible, to whatever degree of risk we want to take on

What needs to be done once

- I need to have a talk with Tommy about payment and about renting equipment costs
- Think and execute a basement cooling plan → how do we feel about the most simple solution of ice water in spray bottles and we distribute a few fans, plus a dehumidifier if you want to be serious about it
- Create a big list of people who are going to be around for the summer and would be into this sort of thing
    - Who would pay us for an event
    - who would work for cheap
- Think about physical set up + how to maintain during the summer
    - I want there to be a lot to discover
        - Become a real one if you do a centurion on a specific seat during a party
    - All the hall ways need to be constantly told to move along
    - Jobs list
- Marketing
    - We lie and tell people we've been doing this for weeks
- Who do we need permission from
    - Alumni Board → the house
    - Event permission for alcohol
- Messaging system for people
- groupchat for the “insiders”
- Iron out other parts of budget
    - Decorations
    - Paying people off
