# Summary

Please reach out if there is anything I have not communicated effectively:

- The reason you will consider going inactive, is because you don’t feel respected
- If you do not feel respected, you have not done your best to command respect.
- To command respect is to command attention. In my eyes, showing respect isn’t constant, it’s a continuing choice to give your attention to someone.
- No one owes me their attention, if I have yours it’s because I commanded it. With your attention I have your respect, however brief, and you didn’t have the choice not to give it.
- I see greatness in you, you have the ability to command respect, it’s hard please ask me how. As I plan to go inactive in the fall, all I have left to give are my words if you want them, demand I them
- Don’t ask what alpha delt can do for you, because the answer is “The unique opportunity for practical leadership [practice] while [practicing] to work harmoniously within a group”

Esteemed brothers of the Alpha Delta Phi. Thank you for the time you have given me in this place, I can truly say that I have gained more from this place than money can buy by practicing every day to be a better man. I see greatness you, I’ll wait paitiently for you to understand what that means for you. Respect is never a given, you have to choose to command respect. The speech that I gave in meeting represents the single best shot I could take to be the change I wanted to see, here’s a summary that will not capture what I did in that meeting, you had to be there. I have nothing left to give, and so I am going inactive. Please reach out if there is anything you think I can provide.
