# House meeting

+60k in ore paid rent and deposits for summer, $150k expected 

Food owed for Feb & Mar

Loans ~35k to alumni, $30k insurance, 

Fall 

Locks & bunks for summer

- Aog to replace locks
- Bathroom locks
- Reno's
- Get move out dates
- Maybe blinds too, depends on budget

Housing meeting for respect of the place

- Better to do it room by room?
- Put in 1 big meeting with them all, lead into Centurion
- Out in database

Party with the Irish, don't let them bring their friends 

Paint day

- How many people are around ~first or second weekend in may

Insurance still being sorted 

- Through strata, ~$80k per house per month.

Goal for next year is to work with strata to be better insurance 

Put cameras into the contract, ask a lawyer friend & deleting data (30 days), inform them

Caution: be careful with net revenue, insure that rooms are kept in good shape, don't rent to people that would damage it.

Touch base with total size of groups, 

Bunk beds and mattresses? Do we find storage during the year? Hard to sell them off and expensive to store

Clear out attic, we don't have insurance for the number of people, keep all fire safe things - we'd lose it to UBC, we're sorted out to be out of mortgage in 30 years 

Contract reworked with Cintas

Adam and balldwep examine Irish prep

No summer storage for people, storage around back for sports equipment 

Next meeting on the 7th, meet at the house
