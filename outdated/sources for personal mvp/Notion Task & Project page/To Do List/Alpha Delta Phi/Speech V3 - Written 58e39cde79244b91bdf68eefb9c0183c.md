# Why I joined Alpha Delt

- I don’t like who I was before I joined, I wanted to become the best version of myself as I believe getting there is the greatest thing the frat can offer you.
- Being in a frat is an endless well of opportunities. Opportunities to talk to women, to take leadership roles, to have cheap housing on campus, to have a say in how I want to live, to drink beer.
- Why did I join specifically alpha delt?
- I liked the idea of being in a frat. I was taken on as a plus one to a more desired person. Alpha delt is the only place that I care about when they gave me a chance. They made me feel like I wanted to be a part of it.

# What I’ve gotten from Alpha Delt

- Self-confidence: It’s only when I start to believe in my own ideas, and never give up on getting people to listen, that I have started to see results
- Fulfillment: People feel fulfilled when they see that they have an impact on the world, I have accomplished everything I have seriously intended to and I am working to change the things that I believe are most important to change
- Self-Improvement: I think I’m a better version of the person I was when I entered. Learning how to be better is sharpening your sword for the battle that is practicing to be better. And the frat gives me every opportunity I seek out to practice.
- A team: People feel happier when they feel like they have a team, you guys are on my team. Don’t ask me how I feel that way, I just do, it’s hard sometimes.
- I want these things for all of you, all the bullshit you went through pledging tells me that you at least liked the idea of this gay gallant ship at some point enough for me to have respect for you. These things don’t happen by accident, you have to practice them

# Here’s how I got it

- Respect other people’s time, I only ever ask people to help me with something or help me develop an idea if I want to specifically ask them about it. If I can handle something myself I do my best to simply do it to the best of my ability. Bother others for help / make ideas happen one on one only as a last resort when I can’t do it myself.
- I have to make space for my ideas of improvement. It is on me to convince you guys that I am correct and that you should care about what I have to say, if I haven’t convinced you, I want feedback as I try again. The best way to make space for my idea is by clearing people of their own thoughts by listening, with no thoughts and open ears. Rewording and adapting my ideas freely after considering everything you guys have to say to me
- I believe that to create the best life for myself I have to practice the things that will lead to that life. Practice is hard. It’s easy to give up on practice. If I don’t have the self-respect to pick myself up and try again, I have not earned the gem of rewards
- I demand respect. I feel like I have a baseline level of respect from all of you, at least enough that I’ve conned you into listening this far. I demand respect by aiming to show each and everyone of you respect, by trying to confront people privately when they don’t treat me with respect, by doing my best to always listen to what people have to say. I would never stand up here and say I have earned respect because I’m older, I’m in a senior pc, because I’ve served on exec, I’m in a hard major, I joined the housing committee I did all those things to improve myself, I have never done anything without it benefiting me first.
- I tried to make this short. I truly strive to live fundamentally by these rules. I don’t always succeed, but

please bear with me as I learn how to. The only way I get better is by standing on the shoulders of giants around me. I am better for the impact you personally have had on my life, even if you don’t believe it.

# Rambling

- I believe that you can increase the percent of your time that you feel happier/satisfied/fulfilled if you increase the amount of time you act as your best self.
- I am not the perfect man, but I believe I have earned respect in this place because I am better than the man I first came through those doors as. I played league, alone, not even on call, naked, high out of my mind, doing nish with my life when I first joined. I no longer do all that.
- It wasn’t an accident, perfection is to strive for perfection with active practice. I aim to rarely try to tell people what to do, I just want to explain what’s worked for me. I determine what works by practicing
- Meetings are not a good place to plan ideas or expect real work to be done, they are a good place to share ideas that you want other people to be a part of. Work happens privately or as a small focused team
- You must never give up trying to make the things around you better, it takes a village, and as a member in that village it is your responsibility to keep trying to win people over to your team, while making concessions after hearing out people’s objections to your teams ideals

# Wrapping up

- I see something great in all of you, I sincerely hope I can help you on that journey
- What it means to truly be IN the frat, is to help others along the journey too, otherwise you have not earned the right to the rewards in the casket
- No one aside from your family owes you anything unconditionally, the condition is sincerely doing your best without the expectation that anyone does the same for you. You have so much to give, please give without assuming people will give back.
- Raise issues one on one, don’t dog pile or talk behind backs, don’t condemn anyone to failure, inspire people to be better. The process of being better feels hard, it’s hard on everyone, remember that everyone has the potential to be better
- If they don’t listen, reword and present again, better. If you aren’t sold on what I’ve said, reconsider everything I’ve done under the guise that it has made women like butter in my hands, the initial reason I wanted to be better was to bang hotter women and I think I could get with anyone I desire at the moment - The grass is greener on this side of the fence.
- Think about what I’ve said, please speak to me directly if there is anything I can clarify for you or literally anything you disagree with
- In the 1890s the US was at war with Spain over Cuba. They could not win without the help of local insurgents. They determined that they had similar enough ideas that it was beneficial to work on the same team with the leader of the insurgents, Garcia. The problem was they hid deep in the jungle, no plane, telegram, letter, carrier pigeon could reach Garcia. How did the US win the war? They made their issue known to everyone who could give valuable input and they got back one name. Rowan could find Garcia. He did, delivered a personal letter that convinced Garcia to get his men to help the US. Rowan never once complained publicly ‘where is he, how do I find him?’ He was the only man who could not panic about the how, he simply did it. No one who wasn’t directly involved knows what he did to find him. He acted without panic.

Here are thoughts you don’t need to read, I just think they are interesting. Nothing I’ve said is an original idea. The pledge manual and countless other books contain all of these ideas and more. You can be your best self if you open up and listen. 

# Appendix

- What Alpha Delt can do for you if you open up your ears and listen to what it has to say. “A Stement of Mission of the Alpha Delta Phi
    - The most obvious and immediate is the unique opportunity for practical leadership experience while learning to work harmoniousley within a group.
- A better wording of our symbols. “The Fraternity’s Job” - R. L. Greene, Ch. 7
    - May I point out another shade of meaning which they can bear
- Things have a tendancy to degenerate with out constant light pressure to be better. Keeping things at the status quo is easy and does not have any place within a fraternity. “The Future of the Fraternity” - Ch. 7
    - The tendency in large colleges of the new school is toward individual selfishness of pursiut and loss of touch with the world at large, and fianlly that the bond of human sumpathy and union sentiment of conflict is in conflict, apparent or real, with the requirements of scientific attainments. From this I conclude that fraternity has a mission to perform **PRO BONO PUBLICO** ain the in interest of the humanity of society
- The real test of a man is to act properly according to his beliefs. Why Secrecy? Understanding the Ritual and You” - S.R. McLaughlin, Ch. 7
    - The ritual serves no purpose, rights no wrongs, teaches no lessons, or enrichens none of our lives by collecting dust. To capure the ture power of our Ritual, it must become a part of our words, deeds, and relationships. As “faith without works is dead” we must incoporate the lessons […] These are the true tests of the Fraternity.
