# Message to Chris

Dear Chris,

I hope this message finds you well. I am Alex Grinius, the Treasurer of the BC chapter in our international organization.

I'm writing to seek clarification on our chapter's dues. My records show the following payments:

- Jan '23: Billed ~$5k for 'Initiated brothers'
- Feb '23: Paid $3.5k USD for our initiated class
- May '23: Billed for active members
- Jun '23: Payment made, potentially more than expected

However, I've recently heard there may still be outstanding dues. Could you please provide a breakdown or any additional information to help resolve this discrepancy?

If necessary, I can provide wire transfer details and financial records for review.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,

Alex Grinius
Treasurer, BC Chapter
