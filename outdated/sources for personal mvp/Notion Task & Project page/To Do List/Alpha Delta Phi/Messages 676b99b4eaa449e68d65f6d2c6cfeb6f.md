# Pledge Wall

Hello Pledges, this is the treasury. Money is what moves the beer & events to drink beer at. Dues for pledges are $600 per term ($1200 for the year) and can be sent to . y term is due by December 1st, and if  you can send it before inish, there is a $50 early bird discount. Early bird for next term is before the 2nd meeting in January. Dues pay for your experience pledging, partying, and importantly international dues & insurance. $350USD is needed for admin (pins, international exam grading, etc.) which most importantly get’s you registered under our insurance. Coverage is any accident injury etc that can happen at an Alpha Delt event (drunkenly falling down the stairs). You’re not paying for friends here, we’re all affected by student financial difficulty. If you or a friend suffer, contact Alex Grinius to talk about it. If you buy things for the frat we can also talk about taking that off your dues. You get monetary discounts and rewards the longer and more engaged you are in the frat. 

Pay your dues and happy international studying
