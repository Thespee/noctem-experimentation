# 450

Hey, sorry for the radio silence on updates, I was disorganized at the start of this semester. I talked with science advising, and they told me they’d contact me with a set of documents to get registered. Nothing ever came from them, and I guess I was registered in the course pretty quickly. 

Furthermore, I could see the canvas page and remember doing the ethics certification on-time. I also had access the canvas page for STAT447, I was also on the waitlist, but to my knowledge was never registered in that course and thought the same of 450. I missed the canvas inbox messages, as I don’t check these regularly enough.

I have gotten into my group’s channel, read though the proposal, did some prep for the client meeting following module 1 (attached as proof), and reviewed the group contract. 

I missed Lab 1 & 2, the module 1 submission deadline (finished afterwards), the group contract, and client prep work. I completely understand getting 0s in all of these, I really dropped the ball. I did lab 3, although just using a placeholder plot instead of lab 2.

I will encrypt my computer asap. 

I’m sorry for the bother I’ve caused, but look forward to the rest of the semester.

Cheers,

Alex Grinius
