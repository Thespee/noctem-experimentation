*Main topics*:

  * Visualization, trends, exploratory techniques, autocorrelation
  * Forecasting and prediction, assessment of prediction accuracy
  * Exponential smoothing and Holt-Winters methods
  * Autoregressive, moving average, ARIMA, ARMAX
  * Dependence properties, estimation, and prediction intervals
  * Other topics if time permits 

*Statistical software*:

  * R: www.r-project.org or cran.stat.sfu.ca <https://cran.stat.sfu.ca/> 

*Homework*: Regular homework (WebWork or canvas upload), lab exercises.

*Team project*: Submission of project proposal in early February, and
written project report due near end of term. Team size should be about 4.

*Exams*: One midterm and a final exam. The date for the midterm is Thu
Feb 26. If the midterm exam is missed, its weight is transferred to the
final exam.

*Course Evaluation*: Tentatively, the weighting scheme is

Midterm 25%,  Final 55% to 60%,  Homework+Labs 5% to 10%,  Project 10% to 15%.

All components of the course must be satisfactory to pass this course.
For in-class activities, homework, labs, and exams, there will be *no
assessment via multiple choice questions*.

*Learning objectives*

  * add to your statistical toolkit for data science applications
  * get more experience in acquiring data sense in working with data in
    scientific studies
  * add to your understanding of probability and mathematics for
    developing statistical methodology
  * get coding practice in writing functions for forecast performance
    measures such a RMS prediction error
  * acquire a big picture view of a general approach for time series
    forecasting with different assumptions for probability distributions
  * understand the George Box quote: All models are wrong but some are
    useful. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box>:
  * differentiate between a data generating process and a statistical
    model that is just used for short-term forecasts
