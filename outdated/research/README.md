# 🔬 Noctem Research Agent

Automated research system that uses Warp CLI to systematically explore research questions across STEAM disciplines.

## Overview

The Research Agent is designed to:
- **Continuously research** questions relevant to Noctem's development
- **Use Warp CLI** for AI-assisted research with access to latest information
- **Save findings** regularly to markdown files organized by category
- **Track progress** with automatic state management
- **Generate new questions** dynamically when queue runs low
- **Run autonomously** until credits exhausted or 100 questions answered

## Prerequisites

### Required
- **Python 3.8+** (already have this for Noctem)
- **Warp CLI** installed and authenticated
  - Download: https://www.warp.dev/
  - Authenticate: `warp login`

### Verification
```powershell
# Check Python
python --version

# Check Warp CLI
warp --version
warp chat "test message"
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Start Research Session

```powershell
# From the noctem directory
cd research
python research_agent.py
```

The agent will:
1. Check for Warp CLI availability
2. Load previous progress (if any)
3. Begin researching questions from `questions.json`
4. Save findings to `findings/` directory
5. Generate new questions when queue runs low
6. Continue until 100 questions answered or interrupted

### 2. Monitor Progress

The agent provides real-time console output:
```
🌙 Noctem Research Agent Starting
============================================================

Target: 100 questions
Progress: 0 completed
Remaining: 100

Findings will be saved to: C:\...\noctem\research\findings

============================================================

🔍 Researching: What are the latest breakthroughs...
   Category: Technology
✓ Research completed (4523 chars)
📝 Saved finding: findings\technology\20260209_070930_q001.md

✅ Question 1/100 completed
```

### 3. Stop & Resume

**Graceful Stop:**
- Press `Ctrl+C` - Agent saves state before exiting
- State saved every 5 minutes automatically

**Resume:**
- Simply run `python research_agent.py` again
- Agent loads previous progress and continues

## Configuration

### Files

- **`questions.json`** - Research question queue
- **`state.json`** - Current progress tracking
- **`findings/`** - Research results organized by category

### Adjustable Parameters

Edit `research_agent.py`:

```python
MAX_QUESTIONS = 100              # Total questions to answer
SAVE_INTERVAL_MINUTES = 5        # Auto-save frequency
WARP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 300       # Max time per question
```

## Initial Research Questions

The agent starts with 3 carefully crafted questions covering key areas:

### 1. **Technology**: On-Device AI Optimization
Latest breakthroughs in running 7B+ models on <8GB RAM hardware. Explores quantization, pruning, and distillation techniques critical for Noctem's low-spec deployment.

### 2. **Ethics**: UN SDGs & Human Rights Alignment  
How to design AI assistants that respect digital rights, privacy, accessibility, and equitable access. Examines alignment with UN Sustainable Development Goals and Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

### 3. **Mathematics**: Algorithmic Efficiency
Mathematical optimizations for reducing inference latency and memory footprint on edge devices. Covers KV cache optimization, attention mechanisms, and sparse activation.

## Output Structure

### Research Findings

Each finding is saved as a markdown file:

```
findings/
├── technology/
│   └── 20260209_070930_q001.md
├── ethics/
│   └── 20260209_071203_q002.md
├── mathematics/
│   └── 20260209_071456_q003.md
├── science/
├── engineering/
├── arts/
└── sustainability/
```

### Finding Format

```markdown
# [Question Title]

**Question ID**: q001
**Category**: Technology
**Priority**: 1
**Date**: 2026-02-09 07:09:30

---

## Research Findings

[Comprehensive research results from Warp...]

---

## Metadata

```json
{
  "id": "q001",
  "question": "...",
  "category": "Technology",
  ...
}
```

*Generated by Noctem Research Agent*
```

## Question Management

### Adding Custom Questions

Edit `questions.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "q004",
  "question": "Your research question here",
  "category": "Science",
  "priority": 3,
  "status": "pending",
  "created_at": "2026-02-09T07:00:00Z"
}
```

**Categories:**
- Science
- Technology
- Engineering
- Arts
- Mathematics
- Ethics
- Sustainability
- Open Source

**Priority:** 1-10 (1 = highest)

### Automatic Question Generation

When fewer than 3 pending questions remain, the agent:
1. Analyzes existing categories and findings
2. Uses Warp to generate 5 new diverse questions
3. Ensures coverage across STEAM disciplines
4. Considers gaps in current research

## Use Cases

### Long-Running Research
```powershell
# Leave running overnight or for days
python research_agent.py

# Agent will stop when:
# - 100 questions answered
# - Warp credits exhausted
# - Computer shuts down
# - Ctrl+C pressed
```

### Focused Research Sprint
```powershell
# Add specific questions to questions.json
# Set MAX_QUESTIONS = 10 in research_agent.py
python research_agent.py
```

### Continuous Background Research
```powershell
# Run in background (PowerShell)
Start-Process python -ArgumentList "research_agent.py" -WindowStyle Hidden

# Or use Windows Task Scheduler for scheduled runs
```

## Integration with Noctem

Research findings can inform:
- **Skills Development** - New capabilities based on research
- **Optimization** - Hardware efficiency improvements
- **Architecture** - System design enhancements
- **Documentation** - Best practices and patterns
- **Roadmap** - Feature prioritization

### Workflow

1. **Research** → Agent explores questions
2. **Review** → Read findings in `findings/`
3. **Implement** → Apply insights to Noctem
4. **Iterate** → Generate new questions based on implementation challenges

## Troubleshooting

### "Warp CLI not found"
```powershell
# Install Warp
# Visit: https://www.warp.dev/
# Then authenticate
warp login
```

### "Credits exhausted"
- Research will gracefully stop when Warp API limits reached
- State is saved automatically
- Resume when credits refresh

### "Empty response from Warp"
- Check Warp authentication: `warp chat "test"`
- Verify internet connection
- Question may be too complex - simplify or break into parts

### Research Not Progressing
- Check `state.json` for current question
- Review `questions.json` for pending questions
- Check console output for errors
- Delete `state.json` to reset (loses progress)

## Advanced Usage

### Parallel Research (Not Recommended)
Running multiple instances may:
- Exhaust Warp credits faster
- Create duplicate findings
- Cause state file conflicts

### Custom Warp Prompts
Modify `WarpResearcher.research_question()` to adjust:
- Research depth
- Output format
- Specific focus areas
- Citation requirements

### Data Analysis
```python
# Analyze findings
import json
from pathlib import Path

# Count by category
findings = list(Path("findings").rglob("*.md"))
print(f"Total findings: {len(findings)}")

# Parse questions.json for statistics
questions = json.loads(Path("questions.json").read_text())
completed = [q for q in questions if q["status"] == "completed"]
print(f"Completion rate: {len(completed)}/{len(questions)}")
```

## Safety & Ethics

The Research Agent:
- ✅ Respects Warp API rate limits
- ✅ Saves state to prevent data loss
- ✅ Focuses on open, ethical research
- ✅ Cites sources when possible
- ✅ Covers sustainability and human rights

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Web search integration for verification
- [ ] Automatic citation extraction
- [ ] Research summarization and synthesis
- [ ] Integration with Noctem's memory system
- [ ] Multi-agent research collaboration
- [ ] Research quality scoring
- [ ] Automatic Wikipedia/arXiv lookups
